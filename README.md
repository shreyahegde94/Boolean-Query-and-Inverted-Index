# Boolean-Query-and-Inverted-Index

This project deals with building own inverted index using the information extracted from the given Lucene Index which was generated from the RCV2 Multilingual News Corpus using Lucene API. The second task is to implement two strategies - Term-at-a-time and Document-at-a-time to return boolean query results using Java.

The data is available at : http://trec.nist.gov/data/reuters/reuters.html for RCV2 Multilingual News Corpus
